This project was created to be a starting point for a ReactJS/Typescript/MUI application that uses jwttoken for authorization. It works in concert with the NodeSQLite project which you'll also find here on GitHub. 

USAGE:
1. Download the app
2. Edit the file config.ts so that the value of dbaseDBURL points to the correct IP address/port.
3. Launch the backend (see the NodeSQLite project for details)
4. Debug/run this app
5. There are default users Admin/admin and User/user available to test with in the seed data of the backend.
